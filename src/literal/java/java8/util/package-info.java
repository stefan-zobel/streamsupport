 * 
 * <h2><a name="Value-based-Classes">Value-based Classes</a></h2>
 * <p>
 * Some classes, such as {@code java8.util.Optional}, are value-based. Instances
 * of a value-based class:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>are final and immutable (though may contain references to mutable objects);
 * <li>have implementations of equals, hashCode, and toString which are  computed
 * solely from the instance's state and not from its identity  or the state of
 * any other object or variable;
 * <li>make no use of identity-sensitive operations such as reference equality
 * (==) between instances, identity hash code of instances, or synchronization
 * on an instances's intrinsic lock;
 * <li>are considered equal solely based on equals(), not based on reference
 * equality (==);
 * <li>do not have accessible constructors, but are instead instantiated through
 * factory methods which make no committment as to the identity of returned
 * instances;
 * <li>are freely substitutable when equal, meaning that interchanging any two
 * instances x and y that are equal according to equals() in any computation or
 * method invocation should produce no visible change in behavior.
 * </ul>
 *
 * A program may produce unpredictable results if it attempts to distinguish two
 * references to equal values of a value-based class, whether directly via
 * reference equality or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization, identity
 * hashing, serialization, or any other identity-sensitive mechanism. Use of such
 * identity-sensitive operations on instances of value-based classes may have
 * unpredictable effects and should be avoided.
