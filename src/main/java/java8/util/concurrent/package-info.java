 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5">
 * Chapter 17 of
 * <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite></a> defines the
 * <i>happens-before</i> relation on memory operations such as reads and
 * writes of shared variables.  The results of a write by one thread are
 * guaranteed to be visible to a read by another thread only if the write
 * operation <i>happens-before</i> the read operation.  The
 * {@code synchronized} and {@code volatile} constructs, as well as the
 * {@code Thread.start()} and {@code Thread.join()} methods, can form
 * <i>happens-before</i> relationships.  In particular:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each action in a thread <i>happens-before</i> every action in that
 *   thread that comes later in the program's order.
 *
 *   <li>An unlock ({@code synchronized} block or method exit) of a
 *   monitor <i>happens-before</i> every subsequent lock ({@code synchronized}
 *   block or method entry) of that same monitor.  And because
 *   the <i>happens-before</i> relation is transitive, all actions
 *   of a thread prior to unlocking <i>happen-before</i> all actions
 *   subsequent to any thread locking that monitor.
 *
 *   <li>A write to a {@code volatile} field <i>happens-before</i> every
 *   subsequent read of that same field.  Writes and reads of
 *   {@code volatile} fields have similar memory consistency effects
 *   as entering and exiting monitors, but do <em>not</em> entail
 *   mutual exclusion locking.
 *
 *   <li>A call to {@code start} on a thread <i>happens-before</i> any
 *   action in the started thread.
 *
 *   <li>All actions in a thread <i>happen-before</i> any other thread
 *   successfully returns from a {@code join} on that thread.
 *
 * </ul>
