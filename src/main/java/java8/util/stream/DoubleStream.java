     * Returns the sum of elements in this stream.

     * Summation is a special case of a <a

     * floating-point summation were exact, this method would be
     * equivalent to:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *     return reduce(0, Double::sum);
     * }</pre>
     *
     * However, since floating-point summation is not exact, the above
     * code is not necessarily equivalent to the summation computation
     * done by this method.
     *
     * <p>The value of a floating-point sum is a function both
     * of the input values as well as the order of addition
     * operations. The order of addition operations of this method is
     * intentionally not defined to allow for implementation
     * flexibility to improve the speed and accuracy of the computed
     * result.
     *
     * In particular, this method may be implemented using compensated
     * summation or other technique to reduce the error bound in the
     * numerical sum compared to a simple summation of {@code double}
     * values.
     *
     * Because of the unspecified order of operations and the
     * possibility of using differing summation schemes, the output of
     * this method may vary on the same input elements.
     *
     * <p>Various conditions can result in a non-finite sum being
     * computed. This can occur even if the all the elements
     * being summed are finite. If any element is non-finite,
     * the sum will be non-finite:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If any element is a NaN, then the final sum will be
     * NaN.
     *
     * <li>If the elements contain one or more infinities, the
     * sum will be infinite or NaN.
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the elements contain infinities of opposite sign,
     * the sum will be NaN.
     *
     * <li>If the elements contain infinities of one sign and
     * an intermediate sum overflows to an infinity of the opposite
     * sign, the sum may be NaN.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * It is possible for intermediate sums of finite values to
     * overflow into opposite-signed infinities; if that occurs, the
     * final sum will be NaN even if the elements are all
     * finite.
     *
     * If all the elements are zero, the sign of zero is
     * <em>not</em> guaranteed to be preserved in the final sum.
