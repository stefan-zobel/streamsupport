     *
     * <p>If the passed stream is ordered then the longest prefix is a contiguous
     * sequence of elements of the passed stream that match the given predicate.  The
     * first element of the sequence is the first element of the passed stream, and

     *
     * <p>If the passed stream is unordered, and some (but not all) elements of the
     * passed stream match the given predicate, then the behavior of this operation is
     * nondeterministic; it is free to take any subset of matching elements
     * (which includes the empty set).
     *
     * <p>Independent of whether the passed stream is ordered or unordered if all
     * elements of the passed stream match the given predicate then this operation
     * takes all elements (the result is the same as the input), or if no

     * <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">short-circuiting

     * 
     * <p><b>Implementation Requirements:</b><br>
     * The default implementation obtains the {@link Stream#spliterator() spliterator}
     * of the passed stream, wraps that spliterator so as to support the
     * semantics of this operation on traversal, and returns a new stream
     * associated with the wrapped spliterator.  The returned stream preserves
     * the execution characteristics of the passed stream (namely parallel or
     * sequential execution as per {@link Stream#isParallel() isParallel()})
     * but the wrapped spliterator may choose to not support splitting.
     * When the returned stream is closed, the close handlers for both
     * the returned and the passed stream are invoked.
     *
     * <p><b>API Note:</b><br>
     * While {@code takeWhile()} is generally a cheap operation on sequential
     * stream pipelines, it can be quite expensive on ordered parallel
     * pipelines, since the operation is constrained to return not just any
     * valid prefix, but the longest prefix of elements in the encounter order.
     * Using an unordered stream source (such as {@link #generate(Supplier)})
     * or removing the ordering constraint with {@link Stream#unordered() unordered()}
     * may result in significant speedups of {@code takeWhile()} in parallel
     * pipelines, if the semantics of your situation permit.  If consistency
     * with encounter order is required, and you are experiencing poor
     * performance or memory utilization with {@code takeWhile()} in parallel
     * pipelines, switching to sequential execution with
     * {@link Stream#sequential() sequential()} may improve performance.
     *
     * <p>A use-case for stream cancellation is executing a stream pipeline
     * for a certain duration.  The following example will calculate as many
     * probable primes as is possible, in parallel, during 5 seconds:
