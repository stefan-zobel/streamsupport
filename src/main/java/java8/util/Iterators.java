     * This method is intended to help adapt code that produces

     * instances. For example, the {@link java.util.jar.JarFile#entries
     * JarFile.entries()} method returns an {@code Enumeration<JarEntry>}.
     * This can be turned into an {@code Iterator}, and then the
     * {@code forEachRemaining()} method can be used:
     *
     * <pre>{@code
     *     JarFile jarFile = ... ;
     *     Iterators.forEachRemaining(Iterators.asIterator(jarFile.entries()), entry -> ... );
     * }</pre>
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Requirements:</b><br>
     * The default implementation returns an {@code Iterator} whose
     * {@link Iterator#hasNext hasNext} method calls the passed Enumeration's
     * {@code hasMoreElements} method, whose {@link Iterator#next next}
     * method calls the passed Enumeration's {@code nextElement} method,
     * and whose {@link Iterator#remove remove} method throws
     * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.

     * @param en the {@code Enumeration} whose remaining elements should be processed
     * @return an Iterator representing the remaining elements of the
     * passed Enumeration
