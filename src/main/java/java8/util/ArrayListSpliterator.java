    /*
     * If ArrayLists were immutable, or structurally immutable (no
     * adds, removes, etc), we could implement their spliterators
     * with Arrays.spliterator. Instead we detect as much
     * interference during traversal as practical without
     * sacrificing much performance. We rely primarily on
     * modCounts. These are not guaranteed to detect concurrency
     * violations, and are sometimes overly conservative about
     * within-thread interference, but detect enough problems to
     * be worthwhile in practice. To carry this out, we (1) lazily
     * initialize fence and expectedModCount until the latest
     * point that we need to commit to the state we are checking
     * against; thus improving precision.  (This doesn't apply to
     * SubLists, that create spliterators with current non-lazy
     * values).  (2) We perform only a single
     * ConcurrentModificationException check at the end of forEach
     * (the most performance-sensitive method). When using forEach
     * (as opposed to iterators), we can normally only detect
     * interference after actions, not before. Further
     * CME-triggering checks apply to all other possible
     * violations of assumptions for example null or too-small
     * elementData array given its size(), that could only have
     * occurred due to interference.  This allows the inner loop
     * of forEach to run without any further checks, and
     * simplifies lambda-resolution. While this does entail a
     * number of checks, note that in the common case of
     * list.stream().forEach(a), no checks or other computation
     * occur anywhere other than inside forEach itself.  The other
     * less-often-used methods cannot take advantage of most of
     * these streamlinings.
