
KNOWN PROBLEMS
-------------- 

 - Note that as of 2016-12-15 all Android 7.0, 7.1 and 7.1.1 releases (at least
   up to and including tag 7.1.1_r6) have a bug in LinkedHashMap's collection views'
   spliterators which correctly report that they are ORDERED but actually aren't
   ORDERED (instead the unordered HashMap spliterators are used). A fix for this
   bug has been merged into AOSP master on 2016-08-17 but still hasn't been rolled
   out yet.

   Since streamsupport 1.5.3 will by default delegate to the Android 7.x spliterators
   you'd be affected by this unordered behavior on Android 7.x unless the bug gets
   fixed or you disable spliterator delegation altogether.

   To mitigate the risk streamsupport 1.5.3 exercises a check whether the spliterator
   for a HashMap collection view reports ORDERED (a bug) and excepts these cases
   from the delegation mechanism (using the reflective implementation instead).

   But note that this check isn't 100% fool-proof as the LinkedHashMap (or its
   collection view) could be wrapped, for example in a j.u.Collections$UnmodifiableMap
   (whose UnmodifiableEntrySetSpliterator delegates back to the defective
   HashMap$EntrySpliterator).

   Since we can't know an arbitrary wrapper beforehand there is nothing streamsupport
   can do about this - you have been warned.
